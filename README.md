Technologies Used:

The HTML file consists of a rating card with buttons for selecting a rating and a submission section. Semantic HTML elements like div and button are used for structure and functionality.

Font Import: I've Uses Google Fonts to import the "Overpass" font for a clean and modern look.

Global Styles: Resets default padding and margin, sets box-sizing, and specifies the font-family for consistency across different browsers.

Flexbox: Utilized to center the container and align items efficiently.

Background and Styling: I've Sets the background color, dimensions, padding, border-radius, and box-shadow for a visually appealing design.

Responsive Design: Utilizes media queries to adjust the layout and visibility for different screen sizes.

3. JavaScript Functionality

Button Selection and Styling: Adds event listeners to buttons for toggling styles on click, storing the selected rating value.

Submit Functionality: Hides the main card and displays a thank-you card with the selected rating.
